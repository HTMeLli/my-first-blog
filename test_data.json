We want to use a lot pressure while using no pressure at all.\r\n\r\nWhen you buy that first tube of paint it gives you an artist license. There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature. The first step to doing anything is to believe you can do it. See it finished in your mind before you ever start. We have no limits to our world. We're only limited by our imagination. A thin paint will stick to a thick paint. La- da- da- da- dah. Just be happy.\r\n\r\nLet's build some happy little clouds up here. In painting, you have unlimited power. You have the ability to move mountains. A happy cloud. Isn't that fantastic? And right there you got an almighty cloud.\r\n\r\nVolunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends. It's a super day, so why not make a beautiful sky?

Let all these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them.\r\n\r\nPainting should do one thing. It should put happiness in your heart. As trees get older they lose their chlorophyll. There he comes. Don't be bashful drop me a line.\r\n\r\nNow then, let's play. With something so strong, a little bit can go a long way. Here's something that's fun.

Almost everything is going to happen for you automatically - you don't have to spend any time working or worrying.\r\n\r\nThe only prerequisite is that it makes you happy. If it makes you happy then it's good. That's crazy. This is the way you take out your flustrations.\r\n\r\nYou don't have to be crazy to do this but it does help. No worries. No cares.

Trees cover up a multitude of sins. Just go out and talk to a tree. Make friends with it.\r\n\r\nWe'll paint one happy little tree right here. I started painting as a hobby when I was little. I didn't know I had any talent. I believe talent is just a pursued interest. Anybody can do what I do. Let that brush dance around there and play. Follow the lay of the land. It's most important.\r\n\r\nLet's have a happy little tree in here. Only think about one thing at a time. Don't get greedy. In life you need colors. Put your feelings into it, your heart, it's your world. These trees are so much fun. I get started on them and I have a hard time stopping. Clouds are free. They just float around the sky all day and have fun.\r\n\r\nGive him a friend, we forget the trees get lonely too. Just go back and put one little more happy tree in there. That's what makes life fun. That you can make these decisions. That you can create the world that you want.\r\n\r\nWe don't really know where this goes - and I'm not sure we really care.

All you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your mind. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. Don't be afraid to make these big decisions. Once you start, they sort of just make themselves.\r\n\r\nWe spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing. The more we do this - the more it will do good things to our heart. A happy cloud.
